YQL_js_Stock_Ticker_Bar
=======================

This tool uses Javascript to pull data like price and other stock details for presentation via a .json call to Yahoo finance using YQL.

In the file I have examples that are calling indexes (indicies) like the Russell 2000, the S&P 500, NASDAQ 100 and some other single ticker symbols.

The json brings back structured data of which I am presenting The title of the Ticker (name), the current price and the percentage changed.

The CSS creates a red/green block behind the presented data and even colors the percentage green for positive percentage moves and red for negative moves.

This code is free to use. Feel free to fork it amd make something specific for yourself.
